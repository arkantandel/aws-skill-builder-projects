- Configured **frontend and backend Application Load Balancers** to securely distribute traffic across tiers.
- Deployed **Auto Scaling Groups** for EC2 instances to handle dynamic workloads and maintain availability.
- Established secure **network routing** using **Internet Gateway for inbound traffic** and **NAT Gateway for private subnet access**.
- Provisioned **RDS Multi-AZ database** in private subnets to enable **automatic failover and data reliability**.
- Applied **least-privilege security controls** using Security Groups following AWS best practices.
